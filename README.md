## About Me
My name is Sierra. I really like video games, art, and technology. I'm a self-taught traditional and digital artist with an overactive imagination. In my free time, I play too much Overwatch and create products for my little Etsy store. 
## Past Coding Experience
My only coding experience was with the Myspace editor, which, wow, that sentence made me feel OLD. I've done some minor things here and there, but mostly stuff you can just Google, so I have a lot to learn, lol. I have a basic understanding of computers at least, so hopefully, that will be useful.
## Career Goals
1. Make a living wage LOL
2. Become a Senior Social Media Manager and or Graphic Designer 
3. Launch a Personal Art Brand
