## About Me
I'm Sierra, I really like video geames, art, and technology. I'm a self taught traditional and digital artist who has an overactive imagination. I spend my freetime playing too much Overwatch and creating products for my little Etsy store. 
## Past Coding Experience
My only coding experiance was with the Myspace editor, which wow that sentance made me feel OLD. I've done some minor things here and there but mostly stuff you can just Google, so I have alot to learn lol. I do have a base understanding of computers at least so hopefully that will come in handy.
## Career Goals
1. Make a living wage LOL
2. Become a Senior Social Media Manager and or Graphic Designer 
3. Launch a Personal Art Brand
